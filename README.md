### What it does:
````
The Gram-Schmidt algorithm accepts a finite set of vectors that spans a k-dimensional vector space and
outputs a set of orthogonal vectors that spans the same vector space. 
````
### Its history and namesakes:
```
The Gram-Schmidt algorithm is named after Danish mathematician Jørgen Pedersen Gram and German
mathematician Erhard Schmidt, although it had been previously discovered by other mathematicians.
Besides this algorithm, Gram is well known for his contributions to helping solve the 8th of Hilbert's
problems, the Riemann Hypothesis, by his proposed series of the Riemann zeta function. Schmidt was
mentored by David Hilbert during his time at the University of Göttingen, and Zermelo credited him for
helping inspire the idea and method of the proof of the Well-ordering theorem. Schmidt was also a noted
Nazi, having to carry out several antisemitic resolutions during his time at the University of Berlin.
